## Terminology

Here is a brief explanation of terminology used in this document.

- **Encryption** - The process of converting data into a form that cannot be read by anyone except the intended recipient. Regard it as "Locking" the data or a file.
- **Decryption** - The process of converting data back into a form that can be read by anyone. Regard it as "Unlocking" the data or a file.
- **FrostBite** - The client program that is used to encrypt and decrypt files.

## Two halves of FrostBite

FrostBite consists of 2 parts. The **Admin** and the **FrostBite**, these are two separate programs that work together to provide a simpler and more flexible approach to file encryption.
