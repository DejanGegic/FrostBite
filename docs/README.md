## What is FrostBite? 🥶

Frostbite is a file encryption software targeting activists, journalists, and anyone who needs their data protected in transit.

### Who is it for? 👨‍🎓👨‍💻👩‍⚕️👩‍⚖️

This encryption software is designed to provide a high level of security for users who need to protect their files and maintain confidentiality. It can be used by a variety of audiences, including:

- 🗞️ Journalists and activists who work with sensitive information that could put themselves or others in danger if it falls into the wrong hands. This software can provide a secure and reliable way to protect their files and maintain the confidentiality of their sources.

- 💼 Business professionals dealing with confidential information such as financial records, contracts, and trade secrets can benefit from using this software to encrypt their files and protect them from cyber-attacks.

- 🏛️ Government agencies dealing with classified information require robust security measures to safeguard their data. This encryption software can be a suitable solution for them to secure their files and data.

- 🧪 Researchers and academics may have sensitive information such as research data, grant proposals, and other intellectual property that they need to protect. This software can help to protect their data and maintain its confidentiality.

- 👥 Anyone who values data security, including freelancers, consultants, and individuals who want to ensure the privacy of their personal files, can benefit from using this encryption software.

### So what is special with Frostbite? 💎

#### Ease of use 🧠

FrostBite is designed to be as easy to use as possible. It has no graphical user interface (GUI), or even a command line interface (CLI). You just run it and it does its job. It's that simple.

#### Passwordless 🔏

That's right, you don't need to remember any passwords or keys. One less thing to worry about.

#### Performance 🚀

Besides Go being in the C++ neighborhood when it comes to performance, there a few more tricks that FrostBite uses to gain an edge. This includes concurrent file processing, parallel scanning, and more.
And it is still being improved, so expect even better performance in the future.

#### Public key cryptography 🔑🗝️

Unlike regular encryption software with which you can lock and unlock your files using the same password/key, frostbite generates a new key on each run. The "new key for each lock" makes it impossible to prepare the unlock key in advance and can delegate the Locking and Unlocking to separate parties.  

#### Cross-platform and cross-architecture support 🖥️ 🐧🪟

Being written in Go, FrostBite can easily be compiled and run on Linux as well as Windows systems. It supports 32 and 64 bit systems running on x86 architecture (almost every PC), on Linux it even supports ARM architecture for both 64 and 32 bit systems.

Besides the binary itself, it automatically detects if it's run on Linux or Windows and adjusts the directory scanning accordingly.

## Guides

<!-- there are 2 separate guides. One is a quick start guide made for people who just want to use the software or standard users. the second one is more of a detailed technical documentation that explains why and how the software works, intended for technical, advanced and power users as well as engineers -->

### Quick start guide 🚀

➡️ [**CLICK HERE**](md/quick-start.md) to access the quick start guide.

**Quick start guide** is a shorter version of the documentation that shows you all the basics required to get started with FrostBite.

**Intended for:**

- Standard users
- Quick recap of how to use the software
- Basic guide for new users

### Extended documentation 🌐📖

➡️ [**CLICK HERE**](md/extended.md) to access the extended documentation.

**Extended documentation** is a more detailed version of the documentation that explains how the software works, why it works that way and how to use it. It was initially the main documentation but was split into two separate guides for ease of use.

**Intended for:**

- Users who want to understand how the software works
- Technically inclined users
- Learning how and why the software works
- Anyone with interest in cryptography and software engineering
